# Employee Tracker App

## This app was created in order to allow businesses to create, store, view and update an employee database via a command line interface. It is efficient and simple which allows for minimum effort/time to keep track of employees. On top of practicing all my software engineer skills, by working on this app i learned to use mySQL and how to integrate it with inquirer.
